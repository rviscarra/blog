I'm a senior backend engineer currently living in 
[El Salvador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador). 

I have been a professional software engineer for the last 8 years. I enjoy 
tinkering with new technologies and learning in general. Writting clean, 
efficient and correct software is my passion.

These are some of the technologies I have inmy toolbox:

- Amazon Web Services
- Python
- Node.js
- Erlang
- Elixir
- F#
- WebRTC
- VoIP
- Docker
